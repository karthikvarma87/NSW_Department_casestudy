calculating correlation using heatmap
Calculate correlations between attendance rates and multi-age composite class percentages
Visualize the correlations using a heatmap
Conclusion:
Based on the correlation analysis, we observed that attendance rates generally exhibit positive correlations with the percentages of students in multi-age composite classes. This suggests that there might be a positive impact of multi-age composite classes on attendance rates.
