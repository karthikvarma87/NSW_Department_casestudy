2. importing data sets all three
3. datasets are:
 1. 2022-attendance-data-final.csv
 2. 2022-multi-age_composite-classes-final.csv
 3. master_dataset.csv 
4. Load the three datasets
5. Cleaning the datasets - Cleaning the "na", "sp","np", 'NULL" and bad data from the datasets
6. Merge datasets based on school_code
7. Pivot multi-age composite class data
8. Merge pivoted data with attendance data
9. calculating correlation using heatmap
10. Calculate correlations between attendance rates and multi-age composite class percentages
11. Visualize the correlations using a heatmap
12. Conclusion:
Based on the correlation analysis, we observed that attendance rates generally exhibit positive correlations with the percentages of students in multi-age composite classes. This suggests that there might be a positive impact of multi-age composite classes on attendance rates.
